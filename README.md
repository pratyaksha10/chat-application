Socket programming:

Sockets can be thought of as endpoints in a communication channel that is bi-directional, 
and establishes communication between a server and one or more clients. Here, we set up a socket on 
each end and allows a client to interact with other clients via the server. The socket on the server 
side are associated itself with the some hardware port on the server side. Any client that has a socket associated 
with the same port can communicate with the server socket.
