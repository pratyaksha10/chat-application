Socket programming:

Sockets can be thought of as endpoints in a communication channel that is bi-directional, 
and establishes communication between a server and one or more clients. Here, we set up a socket on 
each end and allow a client to interact with other clients via the server. The socket on the server 
side associates itself with some hardware port on the server side. Any client that has a socket associated 
with the same port can communicate with the server socket.
